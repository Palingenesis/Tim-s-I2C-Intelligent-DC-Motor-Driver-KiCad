This is my Intelligent I2C DC Motor Driver<br>
It is an STM8S103F3P6 cofigured as an I2C Slave to control a DC Motor using a H Bridge.<br>
It can recives signals from Quadratic Encoder to determin direction and position.<br>
Also with a Quadratic Encoder attached you can set soft limits.<br>
There are pinouts to add hard stops<br>
There is a pinout to add a Station to set a known position<br>
